## General rules of FEIP FIPA protocols



## Rules specific to this protocol

1. CoinDays can be simply understood as: (quantity of coins) multiplied by (holding time).
2. Exact calculation. <br>
  The precision of FCH is 0.00000001FCH, or 1 Satoshi. 

```python
    # e.g. : 987654321 Satoshi = 9.87 Coins
    Coins = (floor(Satoshi of UTXO / 1000000)) /100.0
```

  The Timestamp in the blockhead is seconds from Unix Epoch, and we need to format it to Days. We define the calculation as follows:
    
```
    Days =  (generatedTimestamp - spentTimestamp) / (24 * 3600)
    generatedTimestamp = Timestamp of blockHead when UTXO is generated
    spentTimestamp = Timestamp of blockHead when the UTXO is spent
```
